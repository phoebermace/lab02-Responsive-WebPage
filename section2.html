        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Patagotitan was a particularly large and robust titanosaur. It can be distinguished from its close relatives by a suite of unique characteristics in its back and tail vertebrae, scapulae and humeri in the forelimb, and ischia and femora in the hindlimb. Among these was the presence of accessory vertebral articulations known as the hyposphene-hypantrum articulations, which was likely a weight-bearing adaptation not seen in any other genome.</p>
        <h2>Size</h2>
        <p>In 2014, news reports provided estimates of Patagotitan's size at 40 m (131 ft) long with a weight of 77 tonnes (85 short tons), when compared to the average elephant which comes out to 2-7 tons, which puts the size into perspective.</p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>They were herbivorous animals like their closest relatives and had teeth perfect for stripping vegetation off the branches. Assuming with their heights that these branches would be quite high, the climate at the time was forested as multiple coniferous plant fossils were found at the site.</p>
